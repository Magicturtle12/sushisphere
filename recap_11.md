1. Using an oracle, any Overlay coin (OVL) holder can query a set of streaming data sources, such as the USD/EUR exchange rate, the Consumer Confidence Index, the number of albums sold by an artist last month, and so forth.
2. Any fraction of an OVL token can be locked to a single market price by opening a virtual trade, which is a buy or a sell of a market at whatever value the oracle yields for the data stream.
3. At a later time, the owner of those OVL can unlock them. The value of the data stream will be queried again, the price delta will be computed as a percentage return.
4. The original amount of locked OVL in the owner’s wallet will be increased or decreased by that percentage. OVL tokens are created and destroyed dynamically upon unlocking.

### Team Proposal: Clearwood
##### Made by: Clearwood
https://forum.sushiswapclassic.org/t/team-proposal-clearwood/1591/11
**Summary**

>Hello World. I am Clearwood, a smart contracts developer. Over the past years, I have been closely embedded in the Ethereum ecosystem, working on Layer2 scaling, most recently with optimistic roll-ups.
I have experience with UTXO chains, building dApps, and strive for perfection. Working in decentralized and international teams for years, I know the pitfalls in organization and project alignment while being separated by oceans, continents, and time zones.
I am nominating myself as a new team member. At SushiSwap, I have been working together with @BoringCrypto to make sure to deliver BentoBox on time. I value the collaboration, being able to bounce ideas back and forth, trying to find the error in each other’s thoughts until arriving at an optimal solution.


### Hiring Guideline
##### Made by:0xNigiri
https://forum.sushiswapclassic.org/t/hiring-guideline/1605
**Summary**

This proposal formalizes the structural process to hiring team members as outlined in https://forum.sushiswapclassic.org/t/a-hiring-model-for-wider-solicitation-of-talent/335

Process
1- 0xMaki or anyone in the core team could discuss the need for an extra member in the team.

2- The core team vote if yes or no, it is required.

3- Official announcement that Sushi is looking for a new role. (like any other company when you search for a new employee) We should post on the forum, Twitter, discord, and more.

4- After that, people create a proposal on the forum to explain why they should be the one taking this role.

5- We then create a vote with all the proposals.
