##### -Sushibar v2

##### -BentoBox
https://boringcrypto.medium.com/bentobox-to-launch-and-beyond-d2d5dc2350bd

    We expect to be done with Formal Verification led by Certora (3–4 weeks) after the soft-launch 
    and hope to secure audits led by Trails of Bits in addition to the current ones already done 
    by Quantstamp & PeckShield.

##### -Domain + IPFS
    Sushiswap will be moving to a new consolidated domain in 2021 to reflect better how we 
    aren’t an AMM anymore moving forward but an OpenOrg part of the Yearn ecosystem.
    
##### -Governance
    Targeting AragonV2 by Q4 2021

#### -Miso

The launchpadV1 will bundle together multiple features which is widely known are going to be available out-of-the-box :

    - Freeze of SLP with vesting for teams
    - Liquidity Mining
    - ICBO
    - Farms
    - Auctions
    - Crowdsales

#### Layer 2
    We will move in sync with the greater Yearn ecosystem. Zk-rollups are currently the option privileged 
    since composability is key. Matter labs have been quite supportive, and we are keeping up with the 
    latest development of Zinc.

    Ultimately this decision will lay in the hands of our CTO — core devs and Yearn ecosystem participants.

## Noteworthy Proposals

### Mint SUSHIO Stablecoin with SUSHI collateral
##### Made by: OpenDAOLogan
https://forum.sushiswapclassic.org/t/mint-sushio-stablecoin-with-sushi-collateral/1944
Summary
>

    The creation of a SUSHIO stablecoin provides the community of SUSHI holders an incentive to go long on SUSHI by 
    giving them the ability to mint a stablecoin (redeemable against other stablecoins) using SUSHI as collateral, 
    thereby allowing holders to employ their capital without selling any SUSHI holdings.

    This is made possible via the collaboration between OpenDAO and UMA, and is part of ‘flagship’ series of 
    stablecoins. Incentivised liquidity pools will need to be set up with SUSHI support to ensure liquidity 
    against other major stables such as USDC. OpenDAO will operate and oversee the process.


Thoughts:
Very similar to the ichi farm concept, aswell as frax. The proposal is much more straightforward than ichifarm's proposal however I personally feel the Onsen application process is the proper channel for any erc20 token to earn AP weight. I also agree with several people in the forums that it's in sushiswaps best interest to deploy a stablecoin that is wrapped on the bentobox, rather than relying on a third parties code.
