## Noteworthy Proposals

In no particular order, a flurry of Team Proposals. To be frank I honestly thought all these members were in some capacity already hired/contracted
for sushiswap and have commited to seeing the platform to success. I see this hiring process as more of a formality and will be voting yes for all four;

### Team Proposal: Chester LaCroix
##### Made by: @Chester_LaCroix
https://www.notion.so/Chester-x-SUSHI-7d892cea38be44a193f2356aa4341312

Marketing, Design, and UI chef

>I am very passionate about this project and adore everyone on the team and all the innovative, creative ideas they bring to the table. 
My work situation has prevented me from giving more of my time and energy to this project, and so I hope that by becoming a full-time 
team member I can contribute more work than before, and work that is also higher-quality.Thank you all for your support in the past 
on Miya and I’s marketing proposal, and for all the good feedback I have received from the community in the past several months 
about the things I have been working on.

### Team Proposal : Pedrowww

Community Chef

>Most of you know me from Discord, where I’ve spent lots of time chatting, helping newcomers fathom what we’re all about, and joyfully 
acting as a customer support rep. I’ve also helped to coordinate the several talents that came forward to help with translations.
A proud Frenchie, I also translated all our education supports, as well as the lite UI. I’ve made sure our key resources like #FAQ,
#useful-links (I wrote both) and our docs were always up to date and accessible enough to make everyone’s SushiSwap’s journey a breeze.
But my role spans beyond Discord as I’ve tapped into my network of creatives and writers to elevate SushiSwap’s content 
(I’m currently working hand in hand with Timon to design our Sushi character illustrations and more upcoming fun stuff—stay tuned!)
I’ve also taken an active role in the project’s operations, streamlining processes, reporting bugs and community requests, drafting 
proposals (the upcoming hiring guidelines). I’ve also strived to look at the project as part of a larger ecosystem, creating fruitful 
bridges between projects (Pie DAO, APY vision, Monolith, Token Fighters, Messari) and communities (DeFi France) and I intend to step up 
my game even more 


### Team Proposal: Kastrye ‘Visual Designer’

Illustrator illuminaire/Visual Chef

>I have been working alongside Chester since Sushi’s inception, where I have been overhauling Sushi’s visual brand into something 
completely unseen before. All while creating new illustrations, logo’s, 3d renders, animations, UI/UX designs and recently even 
started looking into merch and NFT designs. Overall I’ve had my hand in every cookie Jar in an attempt to help everyone.


### Team Proposal: Miya
##### Made by: @Miya
https://forum.sushiswapclassic.org/t/team-proposal-miya/2037

Operations and Marketing 

>Hello world! I joined Sushi as WAKIITA and have been managing SushiSwap’s PR/Marketing since Sept 2020. I have been a passionate and 
contributing member of SushiSwap since day 1. You may have seen my posts on discord (@Miya#7795) and SushiSwap Wechat official account 
(SushiMiya). This proposal is to discuss my ongoing responsibilities, onboarding the core team officially, and base salary.




### YCabal
#### Made by: @Sambacha
https://forum.sushiswapclassic.org/t/ycabal-monopolizing-transaction-flow-for-arbitrage-batching-with-miner-support/1910/8

An interesting proposal that needs fleshing out. The details sound interesting but more research planning is required to illustrate the value offered to sushiswap.
updated proposal: https://hackmd.io/@sbacha/ycabal apparently there will be a stakeholder call sometime this week so more details may emerge.
