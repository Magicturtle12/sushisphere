## News and Development


### Moonbase integration with Based.money

>Moonbase creates a way that new projects can offer tribute to the BASED community such that they have an incentive to back, promote and support the new project for at least a year. It could almost be called community mining.  
“You can see the power of our community because our memes are dope and our messaging is cool,” Based Money God said. “Moonbase, the intent, socially, is trying to help these projects and bootstrap community and aligning themselves to Based.” 
It might also be thought of hiring the Based community, in a way. Some crypto projects hire PR firms; some will hire the memesters of the Moonbase. 


>Socially, by integrating with Moonbase, projects can join forces with the $BASED community, which is obviously the best and most alpha of all communities in DeFi, forming a symbiotic relationship. Since $BASED holders will directly benefit from the success of a partner project, they will work together to help that project succeed.

This proposal is to create comprehensive PR and Marketing strategies which help facilitate transparent and immediate communications between the SushiSwap core team and the global community, to improve SushiSwap branding, increase community participation in DAO, and help the dev team build up a more user-friendly SushiSwap based on the community’s feedback.

### Improved YFI-ETH Rewards to Drive Volume
##### Made by: @MrBento 

https://forum.sushiswapclassic.org/t/improved-yfi-eth-rewards-to-drive-volume/577

YFI has been a critical volume driver for SushiSwap, but this is in jeopardy right now as the YFI-ETH pair loses liquidity and volume.

This is a proposal to ramp up incentives for YFI-ETH without increasing overall emissions, in order to restore this strong positioning and drive volume to SushiSwap.

relevant
>

    Raise YFI-ETH rewards to 4800.
    Slash rewards on underperforming pools to keep total emissions in check. some suggestions: 
    DAI, AMPL, BAND, UMA, sUSD, wBTC, UMA.

### Domain name for Sushi
##### Made by: @BoringCrypto (https://twitter.com/Boring_Crypto)

https://forum.sushiswapclassic.org/t/domain-name-for-sushi/541

We have moved from one domain to another: sushiswap.org, sushiswapclassic.org, sushiswap.fi 1 and it’s been a little confusing and doesn’t inspire confidence. Also, with the expansion into other areas, a name that includes swap doesn’t really work. So in the medium term it would be nice to move to a more serious umbrella domain under the SUSHI brand.

Domains in poll:
>
    
    Sushi.finance (10k)
    
    Sushi.org (65k)
    
    stick with what we have
    
    sushi.org (<35k)
    
    sushi.one ($700)
