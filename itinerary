It’s important to reward the community for contributing, as this shows the larger community there are incentives to participate and build. In order to stop the communty backlash that can occur from paying people, it's important each contributor writes up a short/medium length blurb explaining their specific role in contributions with perhas an explanation of their skills/knowledgebase that had value to the project.\n\n###Yield farming with unused liquidity\nhttps://forum.sushiswapclassic.org/t/yield-farming-with-unused-liquidity/94\ndescription: Yield Farming with unused liquidity; they propose an automated system to allow unused funds in a sushiswap LP to be moved around in order to increase revenue for sushiswap liquidity providers.\nidea: While using unused liquidity in an AMM pool is interesting, it sounds like it would be vulnerable to attacks. as soon as “unused” funds are pulled from the pool, a whale will dump/pump with the lower liquidity causing a higher price slippage than if the “unused liquidity” had been left in the pool. Alternative idea could be to create a Sushi Dai equivalent, collateralized by XSushi at a minimum ratio of 500% or more, this would allow other yield farming platforms to easily begin integrating \n\n###Pool reward adjustments\nhttps://forum.sushiswapclassic.org/t/proposal-adjust-pool-rewards-to-maximize-trading-volume/189\ndescription: Slash or reduce sushi rewards on stable-coin sushiswap pairs and allocate the extra distribution to high volume pools on sushiswap.\nthoughts: I would be a fan of slashing stable-coin pools to half their distribution and then allocating the rest to the top three to five highest volume pools on sushiswap; probably to be remeasured weekly. \n\n###Wasabi upgrade\nforum.sushiswapclassic.org/t/proposal-xsushi-wasabi-upgrade/197\ndescription: Wasabi upgrade, all fees generated from sushi pairs on sushiswap will continue to go to xsushi holders. all fees generated from non-sushi pairs will be converted to yUSD and the interest generated off the stable coin will go to xsushi holders\n\n###Rotating sushi bar\n https://forum.sushiswapclassic.org/t/rotate-the-pools-we-incentivize/217 - Have a set of reward pools that rotate to bring in new liquidity and users to SushiSwap and stay relevant \nAKA: Rotating sushi bar, proposed list of 10 token pairs to be launched with 0.2x reward multiplier\nthoughts: This is a good step in the right direction, in my opinion these pools should be launched with 0.4x reward multiplier, as 0.2x feels rather lackluster. and i’d make up for the difference by de-activating rewards from the pairs UNI is currently incentivising. but overall a great proposal. lots of methods for updating the rotating list, interested to hear thoughts.\n\n***\nThanks to ",
