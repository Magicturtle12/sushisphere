##### Siddharth if you could, would you be able to give a basic overview of DeFi Dollar and how it works behind the scenes?


#### Siddharth | DefiDollar: 
##### We have a dual token design: - The stablecoin index, pegged to $1 - DUSD and A governance token - DefiDollar DAO ($DFD)
##### $DUSD is optimized for peg safety, yield and diversification. The basket approach diversifies the risk, by allowing more types of collateral 
##### to be onboarded and allows integration with yield generating DeFi primitives. The inbuilt protocol mechanisms along with arbitrage helps keep 
##### the peg close to $1
##### Currently we are leveraging Curve(yPool) and the yVault from yearn. This is also where the protocol generates income for its users

##### We are also doing a lot of experiments in the stablecoin ecosystem ￼


#### eltrinco92: 
##### Siddhart, will there be insurance covering defidollar?

####  Siddharth | DefiDollar:
##### we are thinking of a number of ways to secure the protocol! Insurance is definitely a part of it, and should be 
##### live this coming week. So you would be able to insure your deposits on chain

 #### Siddharth | DefiDollar:
##### we just launched a $30,000 bug bounty program as well￼ https://twitter.com/defidollar/status/1356981391335043072?s=20 
##### well insurance is one strong pillar in our security triad of : audits, external bug hunters and insurance



#### eltrinco92: 
##### For the governance thing One question that i see before was that what happen if the dev refuse to implement what is agreed by the community through voting


 #### Siddharth | DefiDollar:
##### it hasn't happened yet ￼


 #### magicturtle🍣:
##### Siddharth, how does the system handle a black swan event, say usdT blows up

####  Siddharth | DefiDollar
##### we have a layered mechanism, which protects in case of usual volatility but in case of a protocol deficit which is substantial we have DFD as the backstop reserve. it acts in a similar way as maker is intended for DAI




 #### Siddharth | DefiDollar:
##### more on our stability module soon - it is still under development, final stages . taking feedback from peers



####  magicturtle🍣: 
##### i see, gotchya. DFD are the buyers of last resort, same way MKR holders are buyers of last resort. Sorta nice there's no stability fee ￼




#### Siddharth | DefiDollar: 
##### no stability fee and an active interest offering in form if ibDUSD


#### Rberni:
##### So DUSD is backed by an index of other stable coins? Is that to protect it from an event as @magicturtle🍣 just mentioned?


 #### Siddharth | DefiDollar :
##### that is correct! we are currently leveraging the Curve yPool as a liquidity pool. But new pools are coming.

#### Siddharth | DefiDollar :
##### voting just concluded on the https://www.curve.fi/saave/ pool on curve which we are targeting to integrate next, it will give a bit of decentralized/Non custodial weight to the index


 #### magicturtle🍣:
##### how does the team decide to add new collateral types @Siddharth | DefiDollar is it just based off of governance?


 #### Siddharth | DefiDollar:
##### It will transition to governance, and not just the new pools but also the weights ascribed to them in the index


####  magicturtle🍣:
##### gotchya, when will that transition happen?


 #### Siddharth | DefiDollar:
 ##### the protocol is not that mature yet for the transition, also its not a 0 to 1 thing, it has started though, we already had voting on one proposal eventually the control will transition ; the key is to iterate fast now and create value that needs to be governed actively


 #### magicturtle🍣:
##### ic ic, so in a sense it's already begun transitioning it's just a gradual process that you guys are sort of safeguarding in the initial period

####  Siddharth | DefiDollar:
#####  that is correct ￼


 #### yao: 
##### May I ask - how did you find your original seed funders / network of advisors who are helping you now? Are they helpful/hands on or are they more "sit back and let you get on with it"?


####  Siddharth | DefiDollar : 
##### we have been lucky to have some of the best operators with us in our journey, and they are pretty helpful in helping us navigate the crypto trenches. it always helps to get guidance from folks who have been there done that, but some things you got to figure out on your own and create your own way. we were lucky to be discovered by incoming interest from a very talented people in the industry. hard to name names, but most of our investors fall in that bucket. https://medium.com/defidollar/defidollar-raises-1-2m-to-be-the-risk-insured-stablecoin-layer-for-defi-f5c76a7afe25 this should provide context!



#### magicturtle🍣:
##### So Siddharth, I was curious if the team had been eyeballing any other stablecoins that you wanted to add to be an accepted collateral, or if you had specifications related to what type of stablecoins you'd pursue for the project, the larger the basket the better.



####  Siddharth | DefiDollar: 
##### we are eager to diversify, and the saave pools provides access to DAI and sUSD in a form, so once incorporated we will have the index composed of: USDT,DAI,TUSD,USDC and sUSD



####  Siddharth | DefiDollar:
##### the more diversified the better, we want the index to be shock resistant to regulatory events as well, hence the priority being given to a non custodial pool



 #### Siddharth | DefiDollar:
##### but we are eager to hear from the community what other coins they would like to see as a part of the index and why 
##### another reason to slowly add is to make sure the system is stable, incidentally we started out with the sUSD pools on Curve, deprecated it and transitioned to the yPool

####  magicturtle🍣:
##### Awesome, yeah I was just curious. perhaps some of the algorithmic stablecoins can find a better home in DFD assuming volatility goes down lol


#### Siddharth | DefiDollar:
##### hahah yes indeed

#### Siddharth | DefiDollar: 	
##### algo stablecoins are definitely an area of interest for us, and we are exploring what can work and what won't just like everyone else in the ecosystem ￼

#### CryptoLamer: 
##### @Siddharth | DefiDollar may be a completely different token... ADFD where "A" is for algo?
￼

 #### Siddharth | DefiDollar:
##### hahahah let's consider that when the time comes, but duly noted! ￼
