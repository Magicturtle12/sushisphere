### A hiring model for wider solicitation of talent
Key takeaway from community discussion concerning hiring process
- Just because users vote for a group of people, does not mean they will collectively work well together. While voting for leadership makes sense, trying to vote for and select each candidate within a system will not create a cohesive working system.
- This model creates a race to the bottom. The reality is that the only non-subjective component that would be considered in your model is price of a candidate which will be directly compared against really their eloquence in either chat or oration. So youâ€™ve created a race condition prime for some popularity contest tyranny of the majority in which the best speakers in ratio to their salary request get in. The exact horror that happens far to often in government.
- This model for some reason, has baked into it, the fallacious conclusion that a decentralized community has the knowledge and expertise to select candidates for roles at a large-scale fintech startup? It is one thing to pick a leader, leaders are selected on the basis of vision, ambition and their ability to rally individuals to a cause. Operators on the other hand are put in place on the merit of their expertise, something totally opaque to the average user. Leaders hire based on team need and operator expertise. Not populous vote.
