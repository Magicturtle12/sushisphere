Summary
>Introducing Onsen, our new liquidity mining incentivization program, a replacement of our Menu of the Week initiative intended to bring positive long-term liquidity changes as well as ensure stability of our platform.
Bringing new liquidity onto our exchange, decreasing slippage, expanding our pool offerings and creating exciting synergistic partnerships with other DeFi projects. Onsen allows tokens that are voted to become accredited to participate in our liquidity mining program.
58 tokens pairs will be eligible to receive accreditation. Every 90 days, the accredited list is re-evaluated to ensure that there is maximum capital efficiency for the SushiSwap ecosystem.
