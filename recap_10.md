## Noteworthy Proposals

### SIMP #2 - Onsen
##### Made by: Ctrl (@0xCTRL on twitter)

Introducing Onsen, our new liquidity mining incentivization program, a replacement of our Menu of the Week initiative intended to bring positive long-term liquidity changes as well as ensure stability of our platform.

Bringing new liquidity onto our exchange, decreasing slippage, expanding our pool offerings and creating exciting synergistic partnerships with other DeFi projects. Onsen allows tokens that are voted to become accredited to participate in our liquidity mining program.
58 tokens pairs will be eligible to receive accreditation. Every 90 days, the accredited list is re-evaluated to ensure that there is maximum capital efficiency for the SushiSwap ecosystem.

We will make it easy for projects to contribute to a Joint Liquidity Mining contract in a few weeks by releasing a wrapped MasterChef contract where they will be able to distribute their own tokens in addition to Sushi. (Double the yield!)

##### Basic Application Requirements
Any Applicant token that is already whitelisted at Balancer satisfies the base requirements to become accredited and only needs to conform to points 1 & 2 in the below list.

1. Proposed pair must already exist as a liquidity pool with a minimum of $1,000 in TVL before applying.

2. 1000 SUSHI or 2 ETH must be sent to the specified wallet, with the message containing the token’s ticker and proposed pairing, i.e “SUSHI / SUSHI-ETH” or similar.
    
3. Applicant token must have an age exceeding 14 days, must not charge fees upon transfers and is highly recommended to be Verified on Etherscan.

4. Applicant token must be listed on CoinGecko as we use their platform to provide a consistent way of evaluating the tokenomics for all Onsen applicants.

5. Applicant token cannot be a token that has no intrinsic value proposition, and must have an overall function or purpose for existing. Tokens that are perceived by the community or core team to have no existential purpose beyond that of being traded will be rejected.
