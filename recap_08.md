### Cover x Sushi  Proposal
##### Made by: Cover_Protocol(twitter.com/coverprotocol/) 
Summary

With an increase in security breaches in smart contracts and the crypto space as a whole, it is indeed a scary time for us all. This proposal has two parts that will help build a synergistic relationship between SushiSwap and Cover Protocol:

   >  1. An incentivized COVER-ETH SushiSwap pool.

   >  2. SushiSwap uses an allocation of its treasury to help provide exploit protection to its community. Coverage would be provided in the event of a hack, bug, exploit or economic manipulation attack.
