>MISO is a suite of open-source smart contracts created to ease the process of launching 
a new project on the SushiSwap exchange. MISO is a place for token creators and communities 
to launch new project tokens. We aim to create a launchpad for both technical and 
non-technical project founders, which will allow communities and projects access to all the 
options they need for a secure and successful deployment to the SushiSwap exchange.

## Noteworthy Proposals

### Collaboration Proposal Badger + UMA + SUSHI
##### Made by: @spadaboom
https://forum.sushiswapclassic.org/t/collaboration-proposal-badger-uma-sushi/2156
Summary
>Badger DAO and UMA protocol are collaborating to enable users that have their WBTC/ETH Sushi LP 
or Badger (Currently about $325M worth) positions staked in the Badger Sett Vaults, to mint 
synthetic stablecoins (we call them sCLAWS and bCLAWS). We like to partner with Sushiswap for this 
new product initiative with the purpose of giving Sushi LPâ€™s the ability to borrow against their 
positions while earning interest. 

 - Currently there are $234,000,000 of WBTC/ETH SLP and $89,000,000 of Badger deposited in our vaults. 
 - If all existing Badger users with these 2 vault positions mint CLAWS then there would be a total of $161,500,000 in circulation.
 - We then will have 2 liquidity pools on Sushiswap (bCLAWS/USDC and sCLAWS/USDC) where users can deposit their newly minted CLAWS. 
    - To do so that would involve adding the other side as well (USDC) which would bring the total liquidity to $323,000,000.
 - On Badger there will be 2 available vaults for depositing the sCLAWS/USDC and bCLAWS/USDC SLP tokens. 
    - In doing so users would earn Badger, DIGG, UMA and xSUSHI.
 - Based on our experience, to incentivize these vaults to reach capacity we feel 25% APY on sCLAWS/USDC SLP and 50% APY bCLAWS/USDC 
SLP would potentially accomplish this.
 - For a 3 way split among collaborators that would mean;

   - 48,858 SUSHI (@$8.20/SUSHI) rewards per week for the wbtc/eth SLP collateralized vault (sCLAWS/USDC)

   - 19,543 SUSHI (@$8.20/SUSHI) rewards per week for the bBadger collateralized vault (bCLAWS/USDC)

- This weekly rewards would be up to a maximum of 8 weeks.
