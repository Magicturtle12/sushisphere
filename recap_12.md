## Noteworthy Proposals

##### Made by: Masanobu_Fukuoka
https://forum.sushiswapclassic.org/t/hiring-guideline/1605

**Summary**

Create a sushi-backed stablecoin via the ichi.farm platform, 25k sushi sent to collateral vault on ichi.farm 50k ichi sent to ichi-oneSUSHI liquidity rewards.


### Hiring Proposal: Hire BoringCrypto as Lead Architect for Sushi
Boring Crypto has been with sushiswap since the earliest of the early days. A short list of work done

    - Did the first and only test migration on Ropsten testnet
    - Created https://app.boring.finance 27
    - Identified the problem with SushiMaker and fixed it (serving of USDT was broken)
    - Took over protocol maintenance from SBF and team. Created tools to manage the MasterChef contract through the TimeLock and multi-sig wallet effectively.
    - Championed and organized the Menu of the Week system
    - Proposed and implemented emission reduction schedule
    - Implemented 2/3 lockup (even though I wasn’t a fan of this solution :P)
    - Invented and created BentoBox and the BentoBox Lending solution
    - And I’ve been helping out in the discord and discussing many proposals on the forums, writing some Medium post to inform the community, etc.

Boring's roles on the team would include 
    
    - Setting a roadmap for core Sushi development
    - Vetting the roadmap with the community
    - Delivering on the roadmap together with the core team and many great contributors
    - Helping/guiding any “side projects” to create the best integration with the core Sushi protocol
    - Communicating the planning and progress made and incorporating feedback

Boring's thoughts on compensation

    First I’d like to point out that with the rising price of SUSHI, I do believe the core team is currently 
    a bit overpaid. Although we have to keep in mind that a large part of this is the reward for believing 
    in Sushi when things weren’t going great and sticking with it and taking a risk. This risk should be 
    rewarded.Since I’ve been part of this ride since the beginning I feel it’s fair that I would receive 
    compensation in line with the other members of the core team (or the compensation of the core team 
    should be adjusted, which I would support).
