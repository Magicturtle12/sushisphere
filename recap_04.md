## Noteworthy Proposals



### Official Moonbeam Partnership/Collaboration passes
##### Proposed by PureStake_Nate and Derekyoo originally here (https://forum.sushiswapclassic.org/t/moonbeam-sushiswap-proposal/375/4)

Important bits
>step 1. Take a snapshot of all SUSHI balances on Ethereum mainnet (xSUSHI and SUSHI/ETH SLP will be allocated correctly)

>step 2. Deploy SushiSwap on a new network (Kusama/Polkadot)

>step 3. Airdrop $moonSushi to all holders in the snapshot

>Your $moonSUSHI can be freely traded on MoonBeam and on the MoonBeam SushiSwap deployments there will be LP pools that earn $moonSUSHI as well as a 'SushiBar on the moon', where you get xMoonSushi, etc

>$SUSHI, $moonSUSHI on Kusama and $moonSUSHI on Polkadot will be independent, each with their own 250M max cap

Twitter announcement by 0xMaki 
>  Make sure to vote on our lastest proposal which is a collaboration with @MoonbeamNetwork to open our first branch on a new blockchain : snapshot.page/#/sushi/propos…
Everyone holding Sushi will receive mSushi (moonSushi), the native currency of Moonbeam and a small amount of tokens to interact on Kusama/Polkadot from Day 1 of the launch.
An AMA featuring @derekyoo from Moonbeam will be announced later this week to answer all of your questions with SushiSwap team also present.
We currently have another team working on a @ProjectSerum implementation no migration of funds will be required in both cases. They will exist as independent entities and enable new assets to be natively traded. Hopefully we can announce more details soon! 


### Add xSUSHI/ETH with 1.0x rewards to common pool
##### Proposed by Wanshan (https://forum.sushiswapclassic.org/t/add-xsushi-eth-with-1-0x-rewards-to-common-pool/741/2)
**Summary:**
>Add xSUSHI/ETH with 1.0x rewards to common pool(such as SUSHI/ETH、DAI/ETH) .

**Motivation:**
>encourage staking SUSHI to SushiBar, reduce circulation of SUSHI.

thoughts: I think this is a very sensible change, it doesnt make much sense to me to heavily incentivise Sushi-eth LP's but ignore xSushi-eth LPs.. Ideally I believe the optimal form of sushi *is* xSushi(tide that lifts all boats analogy).
