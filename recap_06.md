## Noteworthy Proposals

### Adding WBTC/Eth to core menu

##### Made by: elee 

https://forum.sushiswapclassic.org/t/proposal-adding-wbtc-eth-to-the-common-pool/1124

Voted against, as wBTC pairs are added to the weekly menu, which is a better place to start. If volume migrates core menu could be a consideration after a few weeks.
