#### Sushi Vesting (Proposed by LufyCZ)

Almost three months ago, we’ve agreed to vest ⅔ of newly minted Sushi for 6 months. There was no clear implementation of the vesting and it’s release, and it ended up being more of a workaround controlled by the multisig. We’re slowly coming closer to the 6 month mark, which means that we start figuring out the distribution and it’s details.


> Option #1: Airdrop the vested Sushi at the 6 month mark and get rid of the vesting.

> Option #1.1: Airdrop the vested Sushi monthly / bimonthly beginning at the 6 month mark (end of March) and get rid of the vesting.

> Option #2: Using a similar approach to Balancer’s weekly claims, use a smart contract that would allow claiming every week / month. This would cost us almost nothing, but the receivers would have to bear much higher gas costs, possibly preventing smaller farmers from claiming their Sushi.

> Option #1+2 Airdrop vested balances under 100-1000 Sushi (amount open to discussion), use the smart contract approach for bigger balances.
